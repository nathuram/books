if we have only one function inside a program. then we can have ATLEAST 1 variable name i. If we did not use ANY scope other than the function's own, we could have 2, with one internal i and one external i. However IF we used multiple scopes inside the function, then each scope could have it's own i. Therefore the program could contain a potential infinite number of different i variables.
